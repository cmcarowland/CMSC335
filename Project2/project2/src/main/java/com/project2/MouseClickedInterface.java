 * The MouseClickedInterface defines a contract for handling mouse click 
 * events in a JavaFX application. It declares a single method, execute(), 
 * which takes a MouseEvent as a parameter. Implementing this interface 
 * allows for customizable responses to mouse click actions in GUI components.
